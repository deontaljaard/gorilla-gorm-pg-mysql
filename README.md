gorilla-gorm-pg-mysql
=
A demo project using Gorilla/mux, GORM, Postgres and MySQL.

## Getting started

## Testing
#### cURL scripts
In the scripts/curl directory, there are reference scripts to interact with the API. I'm a fan of cli tools, but you can just as well use other API testing tools like [SoapUI](https://www.soapui.org/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). More fleshed out tools like the aforementioned are a good idea anyway for automated tests in your CI/CD pipelines.
